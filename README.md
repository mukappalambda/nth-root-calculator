# Python Implementation of n-th Root Calculator

Just a naive demonstration of how the Newton's method is used.

In the terminal, simply run

```python
python square_root.py
python cube_root.py
python fourth_root.py
python fifth_root.py
```

In order to understand this implementation, keep in mind that our objective function is `(x^n - a)^2`.

The number `num_epochs` needs to set larger as the `n` increases.

Of course, there is a better approach to do this calculator. But as I said, the main purpose is just for demonstration.
